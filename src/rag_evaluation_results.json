    "ground_truth": "The proposed MST-AM method differs from Newton and standard quasi-Newton methods in several ways. Unlike the Newton method, which requires the computation of the Hessian and the solution of a linear system at each step, a process that can be prohibitive in large problems, the MST-AM method only needs to store two corrected historical iterations. This makes it more efficient for solving high-dimensional and large-scale problems. In comparison to limited-memory quasi-Newton methods, which require many historical iterates or gradients to form the secant equations, the MST-AM method uses short-term recurrences, making it less sensitive to the historical length. Furthermore, the MST-AM method has been shown to surpass BFGS in solving cubic-regularized problems and is comparable to full-memory methods in the forward root-finding process. It also converges faster in the backward process and offers comparable accuracy.",
